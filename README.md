# Angular Fundamentals @ Pluralsight

The angular app created with [this course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/fundamentals-angular/table-of-contents)

In https://github.com/jmcooper/joes-robot-shop there are resources that we used to build this. I copied it in the _course-resources folder.
Otherwise there is also course material in my [Satellit's trainings](https://github.com/Teto-at-GitHub/training_satellit) repo.
